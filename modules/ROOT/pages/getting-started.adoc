= Getting Started with Fedora CoreOS

== Introduction

=== Update Streams

There are three Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) update streams available: `stable`, `testing`, and `next`. In general, you will want to use `stable`, but it is recommended to run some machines on `testing` and `next` as well.

For more information on streams and switching between them, see xref:update-streams.adoc[Update Streams].

=== Provisioning Philosophy

Fedora CoreOS does not have a separate install disk. Instead, every instance starts from a generic disk image which is customized on first boot via https://github.com/coreos/ignition[Ignition].

Each platform has specific logic to retrieve and apply the first boot configuration. For cloud deployments, Ignition gathers the configuration via user-data mechanisms. In the case of bare metal, Ignition can fetch its configuration from the disk or from a remote source.

For more information on configuration, refer to the documentation for xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

== Quickstart

=== Booting on a cloud VM (AWS example)

include::getting-started-aws.adoc[]

=== Booting on a local hypervisor (libvirt example)

include::getting-started-libvirt.adoc[]

=== Exploring the OS

Once the VM has finished booting, its IP addresses will appear on the serial console. By design, there are no hard-coded default credentials.

If you set up an xref:authentication.adoc[SSH key] for the default `core` user, you can SSH into the VM and explore the OS:

[source, bash]
----
ssh core@<ip address>
----
