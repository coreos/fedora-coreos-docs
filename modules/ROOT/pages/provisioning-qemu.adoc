= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on QEMU

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) instances on a bare https://www.qemu.org/[QEMU] hypervisor.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning an FCOS machine, you must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

NOTE: Fedora CoreOS has a default `core` user that can be used to explore the OS. If you want to use it, finalize its xref:authentication.adoc[configuration] by providing e.g. an SSH key.

You also need to have access to a host machine with https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page[KVM] support. The examples below use the `qemu-kvm` command-line tool, which must be separately installed beforehand.

TIP: If running with SELinux enabled, make sure your OS image and Ignition file are labeled as `svirt_home_t`, for example by placing them under `~/.local/share/libvirt/images/`.

== Booting a new VM on QEMU

This section shows how to boot a new VM on QEMU. Based on the platform, The Ignition file is passed to the VM, which sets the `opt/com.coreos/config` key in the QEMU firmware configuration device.

You can use `-snapshot` to make `qemu-kvm` allocate temporary storage for the VM, or `qemu-img create` to first create a layered qcow2.

=== Fetching the QCOW2 image

Fetch the latest image suitable for your target stream (or https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/download/[download and verify] it from the web).

[source, bash]
----
STREAM="stable"
coreos-installer download -s $STREAM -p qemu -f qcow2.xz --decompress -C ~/.local/share/libvirt/images/
----

=== Setting up a new VM

Launch the new VM using `qemu-kvm`.

In snapshot mode, all changes that are performed live after boot are discarded once the machine is powered off.
If you need to persist your changes, it is recommended to set up a dedicated persistent disk first.

.Launching FCOS with QEMU (temporary storage)
[source, bash]
----
IGNITION_CONFIG="/path/to/example.ign"
IMAGE="/path/to/image.qcow2"
# for x86/aarch64:
IGNITION_DEVICE_ARG="-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=${IGNITION_CONFIG}"

# for s390x/ppc64le:
IGNITION_DEVICE_ARG="-drive file=${IGNITION_CONFIG},if=none,format=raw,readonly=on,id=ignition -device virtio-blk,serial=ignition,drive=ignition"

qemu-kvm -m 2048 -cpu host -nographic -snapshot \
  -drive "if=virtio,file=${IMAGE}" ${IGNITION_DEVICE_ARG} \
  -nic user,model=virtio,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22
----

.Launching FCOS with QEMU (persistent storage)
[source, bash]
----
qemu-img create -f qcow2 -F qcow2 -b "${IMAGE}" my-fcos-vm.qcow2
qemu-kvm -m 2048 -cpu host -nographic \
  -drive if=virtio,file=my-fcos-vm.qcow2 ${IGNITION_DEVICE_ARG} \
  -nic user,model=virtio,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22
----

=== Exploring the OS

With QEMU usermode networking, the assigned IP address is not reachable from the host.

The examples above use `hostfwd` to selectively forward the SSH port on the guest machine to the local host (port 2222).

If you set up an xref:authentication.adoc[SSH key] for the default `core` user, you can SSH into the VM via the forwarded port:

[source, bash]
----
ssh -p 2222 core@localhost
----
