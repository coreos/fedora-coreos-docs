NOTE: Before August 2020, the Fedora CoreOS PXE image included two components: a `kernel` image and an `initramfs` image.  Beginning August 12, a third `rootfs` image was added.  At present, the `rootfs` image is optional, and Fedora CoreOS displays a warning on login if the system was booted without it.  After an initial migration period, the `rootfs` image will be mandatory and the live PXE system will not boot without it.

The migration timeline is:

- August 12: `rootfs` image available in `next`, `testing`, and `stable` streams
- August 25: `rootfs` image required in `next` stream
- September 22: `rootfs` image required in `testing` stream
- October 6: `rootfs` image required in `stable` stream

To boot with the `rootfs` artifact, make one of the following changes to your PXE config:

- Specify both `initramfs` and `rootfs` files as initrds in your PXE configuration. This can be done via multiple `initrd` directives, or using additional `initrd=` parameters as kernel arguments.
- Concatenate the `initramfs` and `rootfs` files together, and specify the combined file as the initrd.
- Specify only the `initramfs` file as the initrd, and pass an HTTP(S) URL for the `rootfs` using the `coreos.live.rootfs_url=` kernel argument.
