= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on Amazon Web Services

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) instances on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning an FCOS machine, you must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

NOTE: Fedora CoreOS has a default `core` user that can be used to explore the OS. If you want to use it, finalize its xref:authentication.adoc[configuration] by providing e.g. an SSH key.

If you do not want to use Ignition to get started, you can make use of the https://coreos.github.io/afterburn/platforms/[Afterburn support].

You also need to have access to an AWS account. The examples below use the https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[aws] command-line tool, which must be separately installed and configured beforehand.

== Launching a VM instance

=== Minimal Example

include::getting-started-aws.adoc[]

=== Customized Example

In order to launch a customized FCOS instance, a valid Ignition configuration must be passed as its https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-add-user-data[user data] at creation time. You can use the same command from the xref:#_minimal_example[] but add `--user-data file://path/to/config.ign` argument:

NOTE: The SSH key for the `core` user is supplied via Afterburn in this example as well.

.Launching and customizing a new instance
[source,bash]
----
NAME='instance1'
SSHKEY='my-key'     # the name of your SSH key: `aws ec2 describe-key-pairs`
IMAGE='ami-xxx'     # the AMI ID found on the download page
DISK='20'           # the size of the hard disk
REGION='us-east-1'  # the target region
TYPE='m5.large'     # the instance type
SUBNET='subnet-xxx' # the subnet: `aws ec2 describe-subnets`
SECURITY_GROUPS='sg-xx' # the security group `aws ec2 describe-security-groups`
USERDATA='/path/to/config.ign' # path to your Ignition config
aws ec2 run-instances                     \
    --region $REGION                      \
    --image-id $IMAGE                     \
    --instance-type $TYPE                 \
    --key-name $SSHKEY                    \
    --subnet-id $SUBNET                   \
    --security-group-ids $SECURITY_GROUPS \
    --user-data "file://${USERDATA}"      \
    --tag-specifications "ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=${NAME}}]" \
    --block-device-mappings "VirtualName=/dev/xvda,DeviceName=/dev/xvda,Ebs={VolumeSize=${DISK}}"
----

NOTE: By design, cloud-init configuration and startup scripts are not supported on FCOS. Instead, it is recommended to encode any startup logic as systemd service units in the Ignition configuration.

TIP: You can find out the instance's assigned IP by running `aws ec2 describe-instances`

You now should be able to SSH into the instance using the associated IP address.

.Example connecting
[source, bash]
----
ssh core@<ip address>
----

== Remote Ignition configuration

As user-data is limited to 16 KB, you may need to use an external source for your Ignition configuration.
A common solution is to upload the config to a S3 bucket, as the following steps show:

.Create a new s3 bucket
[source, bash]
----
NAME='instance1'
aws s3 mb s3://$NAME-infra
----

.Upload the Ignition file
[source, bash]
----
NAME='instance1'
CONFIG='/path/to/config.ign' # path to your Ignition config
aws s3 cp $CONFIG s3://$NAME-infra/bootstrap.ign
----

You can verify the file have been correctly uploaded:

.List files in the bucket
[source, bash]
----
NAME='instance1'
aws s3 ls s3://$NAME-infra/
----

Then create a minimal Ignition config as follows:

.Retrieving a remote Ignition file from a s3 bucket
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
variant: fcos
version: {butane-latest-stable-spec}
ignition:
  config:
    replace:
      source: s3://instance1-infra/bootstrap.ign
----

. Format the remote Ignition file to json format
[source, bash]
----
butane -p config.bu -o config.ign
----

You need to create a role that includes `s3:GetObject` permission, and attach it to the instance profile. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html#roles-creatingrole-service-cli[role creation document] for more information.

. Create the instance profile
[source,bash]
----
cat <<EOF >trustpolicyforec2.json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {"Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"},
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  }
}
EOF

# Create the role and attach the trust policy that allows EC2 to assume this role.
ROLE_NAME="my-role"
aws iam create-role --role-name ${ROLE_NAME} --assume-role-policy-document file://trustpolicyforec2.json

# Attach the AWS managed policy named AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess to the role
aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess --role-name ${ROLE_NAME}

# Create the instance profile required by EC2 to contain the role
PROFILE="my-instance-profile"
aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name ${PROFILE}

# Finally, add the role to the instance profile
aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name ${PROFILE} --role-name ${ROLE_NAME}
----

To launch the instance, need to attach the created profile. From the command-line, use `--iam-instance-profile`.

. Launching and customizing a new instance with remote Ignition file from a S3 bucket

NAME='instance1'
SSHKEY='my-key'          # the name of your SSH key: `aws ec2 describe-key-pairs`
IMAGE='ami-xxx'          # the AMI ID found on the download page
DISK='20'                # the size of the hard disk
REGION='us-east-1'       # the target region
TYPE='m5.large'          # the instance type
SUBNET='subnet-xxx'      # the subnet: `aws ec2 describe-subnets`
SECURITY_GROUPS='sg-xxx' # the security group `aws ec2 describe-security-groups`
USERDATA='/path/to/config.ign' # path to your Ignition config
PROFILE='xxx-profile'    # the name of an IAM instance profile `aws iam list-instance-profiles`
aws ec2 run-instances                     \
    --region $REGION                      \
    --image-id $IMAGE                     \
    --instance-type $TYPE                 \
    --key-name $SSHKEY                    \
    --subnet-id $SUBNET                   \
    --security-group-ids $SECURITY_GROUPS \
    --user-data "file://${USERDATA}"      \
    --iam-instance-profile Name=${PROFILE}     \
    --tag-specifications "ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=${NAME}}]" \
    --block-device-mappings "VirtualName=/dev/xvda,DeviceName=/dev/xvda,Ebs={VolumeSize=${DISK}}"
----

Once the first boot is completed, make sure to delete the configuration as it may contain sensitive data.
See xref:#_configuration_cleanup[].

== Configuration cleanup

If you need to have secrets in your Ignition configuration you should store it into a S3 bucket and have a minimal configuration in user-data.
Once the instance has completed the first boot, clear the S3 bucket as any process or container running on the instance could access it.
See the https://coreos.github.io/ignition/operator-notes/#secrets[Ignition documentation] for more advice on secret management.

.Deleting the Ignition configuration from the s3 bucket
[source,bash]
----
NAME='instance1'
aws s3 rm s3://$NAME-infra/bootstrap.ign
----

Optionnally, you can delete the whole bucket:

.Deleting the s3 bucket
[source,bash]
----
NAME='instance1'
aws s3 rb s3://$NAME-infra
----
NOTE: The instance's user data cannot be modified without stopping the instance.
