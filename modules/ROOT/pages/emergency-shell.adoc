= Access the emergency shell


Sometimes you may want to access the emergency shell. For instance, to debug first boot provisioning errors.

To access the emergency shell intercept the GRUB menu, edit the entry and drop all `console` parameters from the kernel line except for the one you need and press Ctrl+X to resume booting.

[NOTE]
====
By default these console parameters are provided:

 - `console=ttyS0,115200n8` for serial consoles.
 - `console=tty0` for VGA.
