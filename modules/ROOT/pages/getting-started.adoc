= Fedora CoreOS - Getting Started

Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) has no install-time configuration. Every FCOS system begins with a generic disk image. For each deployment mechanism (cloud VM, local VM, bare metal), configuration can be supplied at first boot. FCOS reads and applies the configuration file with https://github.com/coreos/ignition[Ignition]. For cloud deployments, Ignition gathers the configuration via the cloudâ€™s user-data mechanism. In the case of bare metal, Ignition injects the configuration at install time.

NOTE: For more information on configuration, refer to the documentation for xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

== Launching FCOS

=== Launching on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

To launch FCOS on AWS:

. Go to the https://getfedora.org/coreos/download/[download page] to identify the correct AMI.

. Specify the Ignition configuration file as the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-add-user-data[user-data]. You can skip this step, but you will want to specify a key using `--key-name` so that you can still access the node. This provides an easy way to test out FCOS without first creating an Ignition configuration.

.Example launching Fedora CoreOS on AWS using an Ignition configuration file
[source, bash]
----
aws ec2 run-instances <other options> --image-id <ami> --user-data file://example.ign
----

.Example launching Fedora CoreOS on AWS using a registered SSH key pair
[source, bash]
----
aws ec2 run-instances <other options> --image-id <ami> --key-name my-key
----

While the AWS documentation mentions cloud-init and scripts, FCOS does not support cloud-init or the ability to run scripts from user-data. It accepts only Ignition configuration files.

=== Launching with QEMU
. Go to the https://getfedora.org/coreos/download/[download page] to retrieve the latest image suitable for QEMU.

. Uncompress the file. Assuming that the downloaded file is called `fedora-coreos-qemu.qcow2.xz`, the command would be the following:
+
`unxz fedora-coreos-qemu.qcow2.xz`
+
. Ensure the correct ownership of the file:
+
`chown core:kvm fedora-coreos-qemu.qcow2`
+
TIP: The above example assumes that you have created the user named `core` on your local machine. If you did not, replace `core` with the user that will boot FCOS on the local host.

. Specify the Ignition file to the hypervisor. In the case of QEMU, this is done with the `-fw_cfg` parameter, which sets the `opt/com.coreos/config` key in the QEMU firmware configuration device.
+
You must use absolute file paths here. QEMU cannot resolve relative file paths for these options.
+
.Example launching Fedora CoreOS with QEMU
[source, bash]
----
qemu-system-x86_64 -machine accel=kvm -m 2048 -cpu host -nographic \
	-drive if=virtio,file=path/to/fedora-coreos-qemu.qcow2 \
	-device virtio-rng-pci \
	-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=path/to/example.ign
----
+
.Example launching FCOS with virt-install
[source, bash]
----
virt-install -n fcos --vcpus 2 -r 2048 --os-variant=fedora31 --import --network bridge=virbr0 --disk=/var/lib/libvirt/images/fedora-coreos-30.20190905.0-qemu.qcow2,format=qcow2,bus=virtio --noautoconsole --qemu-commandline="-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=/path/to/example.ign"
----
+
Once the VM has finished booting, its IP addresses will appear on the serial console.

. You can then SSH into the FCOS VM as the `core` user:
+
`ssh core@<ip address>`

== Installing on bare metal

Follow the xref:bare-metal.adoc[Bare Metal Installation Instructions] to install Fedora CoreOS to disk. This procedure injects the specified Ignition configuration at install time.

== Where to report bugs and ask questions

Report bugs to the https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker[Fedora CoreOS Tracker] and ask questions on the `#fedora-coreos` IRC channel on freenode or on the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/coreos@lists.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora CoreOS mailing list].
