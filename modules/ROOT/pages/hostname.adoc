= Setting a Hostname

To set a custom hostname for your system, use the following Butane config to write to `/etc/hostname`:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
variant: fcos
version: {butane-latest-stable-spec}
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/hostname
      mode: 0644
      overwrite: true
      contents:
        inline: myhostname
----

Once booted, you can also verify that the desired hostname has been set using `hostnamectl`.

NOTE: We use `overwrite: true` to make sure that we overwrite the hostname that is set up by Afterburn on some platforms.
      If Afterburn does not support setting the hostname on your platform, you can remove it.
