= Configuring FCOS to Use a Static IP Address
By default, an FCOS instance will attempt to grab a DHCP address from the local network. However, if you need FCOS to use a static IP address, you can do so by specifying the NetworkManager configuration in the Ignition configuration file.

As with any custom configuration on FCOS, you can write specific files in the xref:ign-storage.adoc[`storage` node] of the Ignition file.

The following snippet shows how to assign a static configuration to `enp1s0`:

NOTE: FCOS uses https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/[predictable interface names] by https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/coreos-status@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/6IPTZL57Z5NLBMPYMXNVSYAGLRFZBLIP/[default]. Please take care to use the correct interface name for your hardware.

* static IP: `192.0.2.10/24`
* gateway: `192.0.2.1`
* DNS: `192.168.124.1;1.1.1.1;8.8.8.8`
* DNS search domain: `redhat.com`

NOTE: Additional parameters for NetworkManager key files can be found in the https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/settings-connection.html[NetworkManager documentation].
NOTE: During the initramfs portion of the boot process, dracut will attempt to grab a DHCP address. When it times out, Ignition will take over and write the above configuration into the filesystem.

If the interface does not come up correctly on first boot (see https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/358[tracker issue 358]), you have two possible workarounds.

. If you configured a username and password in your Ignition configuration, you can log in to the
host via the console and issue the following commands to force the static IP to take effect:

    nmcli connection down enp1s0
    nmcli connection up enp1s0

. If you are not able to access the host via the console, you can reboot the host and the static IP configuration will take effect.
