= Setting Keymap

To set your system keymap, use the following Butane config to write to `/etc/vconsole.conf`:

[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.4.0
passwd:
  users:
    - name: core
      ssh_authorized_keys:
        - $pubkey
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/vconsole.conf
      mode: 0644
      contents:
        inline: KEYMAP=de
----

Once booted, you can also verify that the desired keymap has been set using `localectl`.
