= Provisioning and Configuration

This guide introduces the in-depth configuration specification for human-friendly FCOS Configuration (FCC) YAML files.

TIP: Rather than read these detailed instructions, advanced users may want to reference the https://github.com/coreos/fcct/blob/master/docs/configuration-v1_0.md[configuration specification] for an abbreviated list of options.

== Ignition overview
Ignition is a provisioning utility that reads a configuration file (in JSON format) and provisions an FCOS system based on that configuration. Configurable components include storage and filesystems, systemd units, and users.

Ignition runs only once during the first boot of the system (in initramfs). Because Ignition runs so early in the boot process, it can re-partition disks, format filesystems, create users, and write files before the userspace begins to boot. As a result, systemd services are already written to disk when systemd starts, speeding the time to boot.

=== Configuration process
Ignition configurations are formatted as JSON, which is quick and easy for a machine to read. However, these files are not easy for humans to read or write. The solution is a two-step configuration process that is friendly for both humans and machines:

. Produce a YAML-formatted Fedora CoreOS Configuration (FCC) file.
. Run the Fedora CoreOS Configuration Transpiler (`fcct`) to convert the YAML file into a JSON Ignition file.

During the transpilation process, `fcct` verifies the syntax of the YAML file, which can catch errors before you use it to launch the FCOS system.

Once you have an Ignition (`.ign`) file, you can use it to boot an FCOS system in a VM or install it on bare metal.

=== FCC file structure
The FCC file follows YAML syntax and contains the following top-level nodes:

* `variant`: specifies `fcos` as the operating system
* `version`: specifies the version of `fcct`
* `ignition`: specifies a remote configuration (for convenience or for platforms that do not allow for the ingestion of large configuration files)
* `storage`: provisions storage and configures the filesystem
* `systemd`: controls systemd units
* `passwd`: configures users

TIP: YAML files must have consistent indentation. See the https://yaml.org/spec/[YAML Specification] for further details.

== FCC file metadata (`variant` and `version`)

The first two lines of an FCC file define `fcos` as the operating system and the semantic version of the document specification (e.g. `1.1.0`). Both lines are required.
