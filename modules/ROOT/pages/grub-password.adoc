= Setting a GRUB password

You can set up a password to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the GRUB command line, modifying kernel command-line arguments, or booting non-default OSTree deployments.

== Creating the password hash

You can use `grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2` to create a password hash for GRUB.

[source, bash]
----
$ grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: <PASSWORD>
Reenter password: <PASSWORD>
PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.5AE6255...
----

NOTE: `grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2` tool is a component of the `grub2-tools-minimal` package on Fedora.

== Butane config

With the password hash ready, you can now create the Butane config.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
variant: fcos
version: {butane-latest-stable-spec}
grub:
  users:
    - name: root
      password_hash: grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.5AE6255...
----

The Butane config defines a GRUB superuser `root` and sets the password for that user using a hash.

You can now use this config to boot a Fedora CoreOS instance.
