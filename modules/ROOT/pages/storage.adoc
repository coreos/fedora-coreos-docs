= Configuring Storage

Fedora CoreOS ships with a simple default storage layout: the root partition is the last one and expands to take the full size of the disk. Apart from the boot partition, all data is stored on the root partition.

Below, we provide examples of various ways you can customize this.

== Setting up separate /var mounts

Here's an example FCC file to set up `/var` on a separate partition on the same primary disk:

.Adding a /var partition to the primary disk
[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0
storage:
  disks:
  - # The name of the primary block device. In virtio-based setups, this is
    # likely `/dev/vda`. Elsewhere, it's likely `/dev/sda`.
    device: /dev/vda
    # We do not want to wipe the partition table since this is the primary
    # device.
    wipe_table: false
    partitions:
    - size_mib: 0
      # Start at 5G so that we leave enough space for the root partition.
      # See the important NOTE below about this.
      start_mib: 5000
      # We assign a descriptive label to the partition. This is important
      # for referring to it in a device-agnostic way in other parts of the
      # configuration.
      label: var
  filesystems:
    - path: /var
      device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/var
      # We can select the filesystem we'd like.
      format: ext4
      # Ask FCCT to generate a mount unit for us so that this filesystem gets
      # mounted in the real root.
      with_mount_unit: true
----

NOTE: The `start_mib` field is very important. In the future, we will make more clear how much space should be reserved for the root filesystem (see https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/586). For now, make sure to leave at least 5G.

You can of course mount only a subset of `/var` into a separate partition. For example, to mount `/var/lib/containers`:

.Adding a /var/lib/containers partition to the primary disk
[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0
storage:
  disks:
  - device: /dev/vda
    wipe_table: false
    partitions:
    - size_mib: 0
      # Start at 5G so that we leave enough space for the root partition.
      # See the important NOTE above about this.
      start_mib: 5000
      label: containers
  filesystems:
    - path: /var/lib/containers
      device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/containers
      format: xfs
      with_mount_unit: true
----

Alternatively, you can also mount storage from a separate disk. For example, here we mount `/var/log` from a partition on `/dev/vdb`:

.Adding /var/log from a secondary disk
[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0
storage:
  disks:
  - device: /dev/vdb
    wipe_table: false
    partitions:
    - size_mib: 0
      start_mib: 0
      label: log
  filesystems:
    - path: /var/log
      device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/log
      format: xfs
      with_mount_unit: true
----

== Reconfiguring the root filesystem

It is possible to reconfigure the root filesystem itself. You can use the path `/dev/disk/by-label/root` to refer to the original root partition. You must ensure that the new filesystem also has a label of `/root`.

NOTE: You must have at least 4G of RAM for root reprovisioning to work.

Here's an example of moving from xfs to ext4, but reusing the same partition on the primary disk:

.Changing the root filesystem to ext4
[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0
storage:
  filesystems:
    - device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/root
      wipe_filesystem: true
      format: ext4
      label: root
----

Similarly to the previous section, you can also move the root filesystem entirely. Here, we're moving root to a RAID1 device:

.Moving the root filesystem to RAID1
[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0
storage:
  raid:
    - name: myroot
      level: raid1
      devices:
        - /dev/disk/by-id/virtio-disk1
        - /dev/disk/by-id/virtio-disk2
  filesystems:
    - device: /dev/md/myroot
      format: xfs
      wipe_filesystem: true
      label: root
----

NOTE: You don't need the `path` or `with_mount_unit` keys; FCOS knows that the root partition is special and will figure out how to find it and mount it.
