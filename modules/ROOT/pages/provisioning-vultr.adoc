= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on Vultr

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) nodes on Vultr. Vultr publishes FCOS images, but they are out of date, so **we do not recommend using the standard Vultr images**. Instead, a current FCOS release can be uploaded as a https://www.vultr.com/docs/requirements-for-uploading-an-os-iso-to-vultr[custom image].

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning an FCOS machine, you must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

NOTE: Fedora CoreOS has a default `core` user that can be used to explore the OS. If you want to use it, finalize its xref:authentication.adoc[configuration] by providing e.g. an SSH key.

If you do not want to use Ignition to get started, you can make use of the https://coreos.github.io/afterburn/platforms/[Afterburn support].

You also need to have access to a Vultr account. The examples below use the https://github.com/vultr/vultr-cli[vultr-cli] and https://s3tools.org/s3cmd[s3cmd] command-line tools. Both of these tools are available in Fedora and can be installed via `sudo dnf install vultr-cli s3cmd`.

== Using a custom snapshot

Vultr supports creating custom snapshots from public raw images.

These steps show how to download a FCOS image and upload it to an existing storage bucket, in order to create a snapshot from that.

See https://www.vultr.com/docs/vultr-object-storage[Vultr documentation] for further details on how to create a bucket and configure `s3cmd` to use it.

=== Creating a snapshot

Fedora CoreOS comes in three streams, with different update schedules per stream. These steps show the `stable` stream as an example, but can be used for other streams too.

. Fetch the latest image suitable for your target stream (or https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/download/[download and verify] it from the web).
+
[source, bash]
----
STREAM='stable'
coreos-installer download -s $STREAM -p vultr -f raw.xz --decompress
----

. https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-use-s3cmd-with-vultr-object-storage[Use s3cmd to upload] the raw image to your bucket, and note its public URL.
+
[source, bash]
----
BUCKET='my-bucket'
FCOS_VERSION='...'
s3cmd put --acl-public "fedora-coreos-${FCOS_VERSION}-vultr.x86_64.raw" "s3://${BUCKET}/"
----

. Create the snapshot from your object URL, and note its ID.
+
[source, bash]
----
IMAGE_URL='https://...'
VULTR_API_KEY='<token>'
vultr-cli snapshot create-url -u "${IMAGE_URL}"
----

NOTE: You'll need to wait for the snapshot to finish processing before using it. Monitor with `*vultr-cli snapshot list*`.

=== Launching an instance from a snapshot

You can now create a FCOS Vultr instance using the snapshot ID above.

This example creates a 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM instance named `instance1` in the New Jersey region. Use `vultr-cli regions list` and `vultr-cli plans list` for other options.

[source, bash]
----
NAME='instance1'
SNAPSHOT_ID='...'
REGION='ewr'
PLAN='vc2-2c-4gb'
vultr-cli instance create --region "${REGION}" --plan "${PLAN}" \
  --snapshot "${SNAPSHOT_ID}" --label "${NAME}" --host "${NAME}" \
  --userdata "$(cat example.ign)"
----

NOTE: While the Vultr documentation mentions `cloud-init` and scripts, FCOS does not support `cloud-init` or the ability to run scripts from user-data. It accepts only Ignition configuration files.

TIP: You can find out the instance's assigned IP by running `vultr-cli instance list`.

You now should be able to SSH into the instance using the associated IP address.

.Example connecting
[source, bash]
----
ssh core@<ip address>
----
