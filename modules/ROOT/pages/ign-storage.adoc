= Storage specification

This section describes the FCOS Configuration (FCC) YAML format for defining the desired state of storage associated with a FCOS instance.

The `storage` block contains a list of objects, which can be of the following type:

* `disks`: List of disks
* `raid`: List of RAID arrays
* `filesystems`: List of filesystems
* `files`: List of files to be written
* `directories`: List of directories to be created
* `links`: List of links to be created

== Disks
Every entry under the `disks` node must correspond to a unique device. For each device, specify a list of GPT partitions. Unless specified as optional, all nodes are mandatory. The contents of `disks` is as follows:

* `device` (string): Absolute path of the disk device. Disks are typically referenced by the `+/dev/disk/by-*+` symlinks. Avoid specifying the disk device `/dev/sdx` directly: when new disks are inserted, the system might re-enumerate devices at boot. This could change the order of the `/dev/sdx` devices. The `+/dev/disk/by-*+` symlinks always point to the right devices.
* `wipe_table` (boolean, optional): When `true`, Ignition erases the partition table before proceeding. Otherwise, the table's existing partition entries are left alone.
* `partitions` (object list, optional): List of partitions to be written to the partition table of the device. Each partition occupies a slot in the table. You can either specify the slot directly with the `number` node, or specify `number: 0` and supply a unique `label`.
** `label` (string, optional): GPT PARTLABEL for the partition.
** `number` (integer, optional): Slot number occupied by the partition, starting at 1. To use the next available slot, specify `0`. In this case, you should also specify a unique `label`.
** `size_mib` (integer, optional): Size of the partition in mebibytes. If `0`, the partition is sized as large as possible. Note: 1 mebibytes = 1024 * 1024 bytes.
** `start_mib` (integer, optional): Start position of the partition from the beginning of the disk, in mebibytes. If `0`, the partition will be placed at the start of the largest block available.
** `type_guid` (string, optional): Partition type GUID. If omitted, it defaults to `0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4`, the Linux native file system GUID. The ultimate reference list for the type GUIDs is currently the https://sourceforge.net/p/gptfdisk/code/ci/master/tree/parttypes.cc[parttypes.cc] file in the GPT fdisk source code. A more readable list can be found in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table#Partition_type_GUIDs[GUID Partition Table article on Wikipedia].
** `guid` (string, optional, must be unique): GUID of the partition. You can omit this when creating new partitions.
** `wipe_partition_entry` (boolean, optional)
*** true: Ignition erases any existing partition that does not match this entry.
*** false: Ignition leaves the partition unchanged, which will fail.
** `should_exist` (boolean, optional). Defaults to `true`.
*** true: If `true` and if it does not already exist, the partition with the specified `number` is created. If the partition exists, and `wipe_partition_entry` is `false`, then `number` must be specified as a non-zero integer, and `label`, `start_mib`, `size_mib`, `guid` and `type_guid` must all be omitted.
*** false: If `false` and the partition exists, Ignition looks at the `wipe_partition_entry` value and deletes the partition if `true`, or fails if `false`.

== Raid

Every entry under the `raid` node must correspond to a unique RAID array. The resulting configuration is implemented as an mdadm "software" RAID. The contents of `raid` is as follows. Unless specified as optional, all nodes are mandatory.

* `name` (string): Name of the resulting md device.
* `level` (string): Redundancy level of the array. See the supported levels in the Fedora `mdadm` man page. Examples: `linear`, `raid0`, `raid`.
* `devices` (list of strings): List of devices that should be part of the array, referenced by absolute path.
* `spares` (optional, integer): Number of spares in the array, if applicable.
* `options` (optional, list of strings): Additional options to be passed to `mdadm`.

== File systems

Entries under the `filesystems` node list the file systems to be created and mounted. Each file system must have a unique device. The contents of `filesystems` is as follows. Unless specified as optional, all nodes are mandatory.

* `path` (string): Mount point of of the filesystem while Ignition is running, relative to where the root filesystem will be mounted. This is not necessarily the same as where it should be mounted in the real root, but you should set it as such.
* `device` (string): Absolute path of the device.
* `format` (string): File system "format" (ie - file system type). Accepted values: `ext4`, `btrfs`, `xfs`, `vfat`, or `swap`.
* `wipe_filesystem` (boolean, optional): If true, the device is wiped before the file system is created.
* `label` (string, optional): Label of the file system.
* `uuid` (string, optional): UUID of the file system.
* `options` (list of strings, optional): Additional options to be passed to `mkfs`.

== Files
The `files` node lets you define a list of files, identified by a unique path, that Ignition will create with the required contents and attributes as needed.

An empty file would not be very useful, so the files can be defined with a `contents` option to specify either a source from which the file will be copied, or inline data.

The contents of `files` is as follows. Unless specified as optional, all nodes are mandatory.

* `path` (string, must be unique): Absolute path of the file to be created.
* `overwrite` (boolean, optional): Defaults to `false`. If `true`, `source` must be specified, and any preexisting file of the specified `path` will be overwritten with the contents of `source`.
* `contents` (object, optional): Specifies the contents of the file.
** `compression` (string, optional): Type of compression of the source. Possible values are `null` or `gzip`. Defaults to `null`. Compression cannot be specified if `source` uses an `s3` scheme.
** `source` (string, optional):  Mandatory if `overwrite` is true. Mutually exclusive with option `inline`. Specifies the URL of the source to be copied to the `path`. Supported schemes are `http`, `https`, `tftp`, `s3`, and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397[`data`]. If you use the `http` scheme, you should specify a verification option to ensure the remote contents have not changed. If `source` is omitted, Ignition checks if the file already exists:
*** File exists: Ignition does nothing.
*** File does not exist: Ignition creates an empty file.
** `inline` (string, optional): Mutually exclusive with option `source`. Specifies a string to be written to the file.
** `verification` (object, optional): Tells Ignition to verify the contents of the file. Currently, only one verification option has been implemented: `hash`.
*** `hash` (string, mandatory if `verification` is specified): Hash of the file contents, in the form `+<type>-<value>+`. The only supported `type` is `sha512`.
* `append` (object list, optional): This node has the same options as `source`. It specifies contents to be appended to the (presumably existing) file.
** `compression`: See `contents`.
** `source`: See `contents`.
** `inline`: See `contents`.
** `verification`: See `contents`.
*** `hash`: See `contents`.
* `mode` (integer, optional): Specifies the file's permission or mode. If `mode` is not specified, Ignition checks to see if the file already exists:
*** File exists: Keep the existing file mode if `overwrite` is false and `source` is not specified. Otherwise, set mode to octal 0644.
*** File does not exist: `mode` defaults to octal 0644.
* `user` (object, optional): Specifies the user ID of the file owner. Either an ID or name must be specified.
** `id` (integer, optional): User ID of the owner.
** `name` (string, optional): User name of the owner.
* `group` (object, optional): Specifies the group of the file owner. Either an ID or name must be specified.
** `id` (integer, optional): Group ID of the owner.
** `name` (string, optional): Group name of the owner.

== Directories
The `directories` node specifies a list of directories, identified by a unique path, that Ignition creates as needed.

The `directories` structure is similar to the `files` structure. Unless specified as optional, all nodes are mandatory.

* `path` (string): See Files.
* `overwrite` (boolean, optional): Defaults to `false`. If `true`, preexisting files or directories at the specified `path` are removed. If `overwrite` is `false` and a file system object already exists at the specified `path`, Ignition checks the type of the existing file system object:
** Existing path is a directory: Ignition does nothing
** Existing path is not a directory: Ignition fails.
* `mode` (integer, optional): Specifies the directory's permission or mode. If `mode` is not specified, Ignition checks to see if the directory already exists:
** Directory exists: if `overwrite` is false, Ignition does nothing, otherwise the mode is set to octal `0755`.
** Directory does not exist: The `mode` is set to `0755`.
* `user`: Specifies the directory owner. See Files.
** `id`: See Files
** `name`: See Files
* `group`: Specifies the directory group. See Files.
** `id`: See Files
** `name`: See Files

== Links
The `links` node lets you specify links (hard or symbolic) to be created by Ignition as needed.

The contents of `links` is as follows. Unless specified as optional, all nodes are mandatory.

* `path` (string, must be unique): Absolute path of the link to be created.
* `overwrite` (boolean, optional): Defaults to `false`. If `false` and a link already exists at the specified path, Ignition sets only the owner and group.
* `user`: Specifies the link owner. See Files.
** `id`: See Files.
** `name`: See Files.
* `group`: Specifies the link group. See Files.
** `id`: See Files.
** `name`: See Files.
* `target` (string): Target path of the link.
* `hard` (boolean, optional): Defaults to `false`. If `true`, Ignition creates a hard link. If false, it creates a symbolic link
