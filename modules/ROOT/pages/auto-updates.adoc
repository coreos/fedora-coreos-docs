= Auto-updates

Fedora CoreOS provides atomic updates and rollbacks via https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[OSTree] deployments.

By default, the OS performs continuous auto-updates via two components:

 * https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree[rpm-ostree] handles multiple on-disk OSTree deployments, and it can switch between them at boot-time.
 * https://github.com/coreos/zincati[Zincati] continuously checks for OS updates and applies them via rpm-ostree.

== Wariness to updates

The local Zincati agent periodically checks with a remote service to see when updates are available.
A custom "rollout wariness" value (see https://github.com/coreos/zincati/blob/0.0.6/docs/usage/auto-updates.md#phased-rollouts-client-wariness-canaries[documentation]) can be provided to let the server know how eager, or how risk-averse the node is to receiving updates.

The `rollout_wariness` parameter can be set to a floating point value between `0.0` (most eager) and `1.0` (most conservative).
In order to receive updates very early in the phased rollout cycle, a node can be configured with a low value (e.g. `0.001`).
This can be done during provisioning by using the https://github.com/coreos/fcct[FCCT] configuration snippet shown below:

.Example: configuring Zincati rollout wariness
[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.0.0
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/zincati/config.d/51-rollout-wariness.toml
      contents:
        inline: |
          [identity]
          rollout_wariness = 0.001

== OS-update finalization

In order to finalize an OS update, a machine needs to perform a reboot.
As this is an invasive action which may cause service disruption, Zincati allows the cluster administrator to control when nodes are allowed to reboot in order to finalize updates.

The following finalization strategies are available:

 * immediately reboot to apply an update, as soon as it is downloaded and staged locally
 * use an external lock-manager to reboot a fleet of machines in a coordinated way

A specific finalization strategy can be configured on each node.

The https://github.com/coreos/fcct[FCCT] snippet below shows how to use a custom lock-manager:

.Example: configuring Zincati updates strategy
[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.0.0
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/zincati/config.d/55-updates-strategy.toml
      contents:
        inline: |
          [updates]
          strategy = "fleet_lock"
          [updates.fleet_lock]
          base_url = "https://example.com/lock-manager/"
