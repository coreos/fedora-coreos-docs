= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on Exoscale

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) instances on https://exoscale.com[Exoscale] Cloud Hosting.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning an FCOS machine, it is recommended to have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

If you do not want to use Ignition to get started, you can make use of the https://coreos.github.io/afterburn/platforms/[Afterburn support] and provide an SSH key via the cloud provider and continue from there.

You also need to have access to an Exoscale account. https://portal.exoscale.com/register[Register] if you don't have one.

== Uploading an FCOS image as a custom Template

NOTE: Exoscale offers official FCOS templates, but they are currently out of date. For now we recommend creating your own template. Track progress on fixing this in https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/1166[#1166].

Exoscale provides https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/compute/custom-templates[Custom Templates] to be able to upload any cloud image. To create a Custom Template you first need to download and decompress the image.

.Download and decompress the QCOW2 image with https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer[coreos-installer]
[source, bash]
----
STREAM="stable"
coreos-installer download -d -s "${STREAM}" -p exoscale -f qcow2.xz
----

Alternatively, QCOW2 images can be downloaded from the https://getfedora.org/coreos/download?tab=cloud_operators[download page] and manually decompressed.

Next you can https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/compute/custom-templates/#register-a-custom-template[Register a Custom Template]. This can be done from the https://portal.exoscale.com/compute/templates/add[Web Portal] or the https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/tools/exoscale-command-line-interface/[Exoscale CLI]. Either option requires the uncompressed image to be uploaded somewhere public and for the URL and an MD5 checksum to be provided during registration. One option is to use the object storage provided by Exoscale to host the image.

.Upload to Object Storage and create Custom Template
[source, bash]
----
# Set the version and calcuate the checksum
FCOS_VERSION='...'
FILE="fedora-coreos-${FCOS_VERSION}-exoscale.x86_64.qcow2"
CHECKSUM=$(md5sum $FILE | cut -d " " -f 1)

# Upload to object storage
BUCKET='newbucket'
exo storage mb "sos://${BUCKET}"
exo storage upload --acl public-read $FILE "sos://${BUCKET}/image-import/"

# Create the template using given URL and CHECKSUM
URL=$(exo storage show "sos://${BUCKET}/image-import/$FILE" --output-template "{{.URL}}")
TEMPLATE="fedora-coreos-${FCOS_VERSION}"
exo compute instance-template register --boot-mode=uefi $TEMPLATE $URL $CHECKSUM
----

You can then view the template using `exo compute instance-template show --visibility=private $TEMPLATE`.

== Launching a VM instance

You can provision a FCOS instance using the Exoscale https://portal.exoscale.com/compute/instances/add[Web Portal] or via the https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/tools/exoscale-command-line-interface/[Exoscale CLI].

NOTE: You will need to use at least version https://github.com/exoscale/cli/releases/tag/v1.54.0[v1.54.0] of the Exoscale CLI.

WARNING: Do not use the `--cloud-init-compress` argument to the CLI.  It causes the Ignition config to be passed compressed to the instance and https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/1160[Ignition doesn't tolerate that].

.Launching a new instance with Exoscale CLI
[source, bash]
----
NAME='worker'
TYPE='standard.medium'
DISK='10' # in GiB
SSHKEY='mykey'
TEMPLATE=$TEMPLATE # template name set above
exo compute instance create $NAME \
    --disk-size $DISK \
    --ssh-key $SSHKEY \
    --template $TEMPLATE \
    --template-visibility private \
    --cloud-init "path/to/ignition-file.ign"
----

NOTE: If just SSH access is desired and no further customization is required, you don't need to pass any Ignition file and you can omit the `--cloud-init` argument.

Now you can find the IP address of the instance via `exo compute instance show $NAME` and SSH into the instance. If you didnâ€™t change the defaults, the username is `core` and `ssh core@$IP` should work.
