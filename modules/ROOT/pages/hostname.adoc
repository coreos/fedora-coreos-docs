= Setting a Hostname

To set a custom hostname for your system, use the following FCC to write to `/etc/hostname`:

[source,yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0
passwd:
  users:
    - name: core
      ssh_authorized_keys:
        - $pubkey
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/hostname
      mode: 0644
      contents:
        inline: myhostname
----

Once booted, you can also verify that the desired hostname has been set using `hostnamectl`.
