= Migrating from CoreOS Container Linux (CL) to Fedora CoreOS (FCOS)

Fedora CoreOS is the official successor of CoreOS Container Linux, which will https://coreos.com/os/eol/[reach its end of life] on May 26, 2020. This page attempts to document the differences between CL and FCOS to ease the transition to FCOS.

:toc:

== Introduction

To migrate from CL to FCOS, you must convert your old Container Linux Configs, Ignition configs, or `cloud-config` files to a xref:fcct-config.adoc[Fedora CoreOS Config (FCC)] and adapt the contents for FCOS. Since many of the configuration details have changed, you should reference this page and the https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/159[CL migration issue] on GitHub.

== Installation changes

The following changes have been made to the installation process:

* The `coreos-install` script has been replaced with https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer[`coreos-installer`]. It offers similar functionality.
* The `coreos.autologin` kernel command-line parameter is not currently supported in FCOS.
* Certain CL platforms, such as Vagrant, are not yet supported in FCOS. Refer to the https://getfedora.org/coreos/download/[Download page] to see the available image types.

== Software package changes

* `etcd` is not included in FCOS. Refer to xref:running-containers.adoc#running-etcd[Running etcd] for instructions to run it as a container on FCOS.
* `flannel` is not included in FCOS.
* The Podman container runtime is included in FCOS and is the recommended container runtime. The rkt container runtime is not included.
* FCOS does not have a recommended mechanism to select the version of `docker`.
* Network configuration is now handled by NetworkManager instead of `systemd-networkd`.
* For time synchronization, use https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/system-administrators-guide/servers/Configuring_NTP_Using_the_chrony_Suite/[`chronyd`] rather than `ntpd` or `systemd-timesyncd`.
* Automatic updates are now coordinated by Zincati, as described in the https://github.com/coreos/zincati/blob/master/docs/usage/auto-updates.md[Zincati documentation]. The rollback mechanism (via grub) is now provided by https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/blob/master/README.md[`rpm-ostree`].
* The functionality of the reboot manager (`locksmith`) is rolled into https://github.com/coreos/zincati/blob/master/README.md[Zincati].
* The `update-ssh-keys` tool is not provided on FCOS. To update SSH keys, edit `~/ssh/authorized_keys` directly. Note that Ignition and Afterburn place SSH keys in separate files in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys.d`.

== Configuration changes

When writing FCC files, note the following changes:

* `coreos-metadata` is now https://github.com/coreos/afterburn/blob/master/README.md[Afterburn]. The prefix of the metadata variable names has changed from `COREOS_` to `AFTERBURN_`, and the following platform names have changed:
** `EC2` is now `AWS`
** `GCE` is now `GCP`
+
For more info, see the https://github.com/coreos/afterburn/blob/master/README.md[Afterburn readme].

* By default, FCOS does not allow password logins via SSH. We recommend configuring SSH keys instead.
* Because `usermod` is not yet fully-functional on FCOS, there is a `docker` group in the `/etc/group` file. This is a stop-gap measure to facilitate a smooth transition to FCOS. The team is working on a more functional `usermod`, at which time the `docker` group will no longer be included by default. See the https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/2[docker group issue].
* There is no way to create directories below the `/` directory. Changes are restricted to `/etc` and `/var`. Refer to the documentation for the xref:ign-storage.adoc[`storage`] node of the FCC configuration for details about writing directories and files to FCOS.
* FCCs no longer have a separate section for network configuration. Use the FCC `files` section to write a https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nm-settings-keyfile.html[NetworkManager key file] instead.

== Operator notes

* FCOS provides https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-coreos-out-of-preview/[best-effort stability], and may occasionally include regressions or breaking changes for some use cases or workloads.
* CL had three release channels: `alpha`, `beta`, and `stable`. The FCOS production https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/blob/master/Design.md#release-streams[release streams] are `next`, `testing`, and `stable`, with somewhat different semantics.
* In general, SELinux confinement should work the same as in Fedora.
* To deploy an Ignition config as part of a PXE image (a "custom OEM" in CL terminology), follow the https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/booting-with-pxe.html#adding-a-custom-oem[same process] as in CL, but place the `config.ign` file in the root of the archive.
* In CL, metrics/telemetry data was collected by the update mechanism. In FCOS, the data is collected (without unique identifiers) by https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-pinger[`fedora-coreos-pinger`].
** To prevent any information from being collected or transmitted by the pinger, you can disable reporting. To do so, drop a config snippet into `/etc/fedora-coreos-pinger/config.d/99-disable-reporting.toml` containing the following:
+
[source]
----
[reporting]
enabled = false
----
* Cloud CLI clients are not included in FCOS. There is an initiative to create a "tools" container to run on FCOS.
* When opening an existing file in a sticky directory, the behavior differs from CL. See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/2732587540035227fe59e4b64b60127352611b35[the relevant systemd commit].
* CL left Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) enabled but advised users to turn it off if their systems were vulnerable to certain issues such as https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/l1tf.html[L1TF] or https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html[MDS]. By default, FCOS https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/blob/master/Design.md#automatically-disable-smt-when-needed-to-address-vulnerabilities[automatically disables SMT] for vulnerable systems.

== Implementation notes
//* Partition layout differences. CL is at https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/sdk-disk-partitions.html. I can't make heads or tails of the results of the discussions in https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/94.
* The default filesystem on CL was `ext4`. On FCOS, the default is `xfs`.
* While CL used systemd socket activation for `sshd`, FCOS starts `sshd` at startup by default.
* CL had an "OEM partition" at `/usr/share/oem` with a user-customizable GRUB config and some additional tools, but FCOS does not have this.
//* Filesystem resizing differences. Need more info on FCOS side.
