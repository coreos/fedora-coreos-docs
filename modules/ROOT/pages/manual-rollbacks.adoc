= Manual Rollbacks

When an update is complete, the previous OS deployment remains on disk. If an update causes issues, you can use it as a fallback. This is a manual operation that requires human intervention and console access.

== Temporary rollback

To temporarily boot the previous OS deployment, hold down `Shift` during the OS boot process. When the bootloader menu appears, select the relevant OS entry in the menu.

== Permanent rollback

To permanently revert to the previous OS deployment, log into the target node, and run `rpm-ostree rollback -r`.
This operation marks the previous OS deployment as the default, and immediately reboots into it.
