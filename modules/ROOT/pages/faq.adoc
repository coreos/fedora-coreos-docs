= Fedora CoreOS Frequently Asked Questions

If you have other questions than are mentioned here or want to discuss
further, join us in our IRC channel,
irc://irc.freenode.org/#fedora-coreos, or on our new
https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/server/coreos[discussion board].
Please refer back here as some questions and answers will likely get
updated.

== What is Fedora CoreOS?

Fedora CoreOS is an automatically updating, minimal, monolithic,
container-focused operating system, designed for clusters but also
operable standalone, optimized for Kubernetes but also great without it.
It aims to combine the best of both CoreOS Container Linux and Fedora
Atomic Host, integrating technology like Ignition from Container Linux
with rpm-ostree and SELinux hardening from Project Atomic. Its goal is
to provide the best container host to run containerized workloads
securely and at scale.

== How does Fedora CoreOS relate to Red Hat CoreOS?

Fedora CoreOS is a freely available, community distribution that is the
upstream basis for Red Hat CoreOS. While Fedora CoreOS embraces a
variety of containerized use cases, Red Hat CoreOS provides a
focused OS for OpenShift, released and life-cycled in tandem
with the platform.

== Does Fedora CoreOS replace Container Linux? What happens to CL?

Fedora CoreOS is the official successor to CoreOS Container Linux, but it
is not a drop-in replacement. CoreOS Container Linux will reach its
https://coreos.com/os/eol/[end of life] on May 26, 2020, and will no longer
receive updates after that date. For notes on migrating from Container Linux
to Fedora CoreOS, see the xref:migrate-cl.adoc[migration guide].

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-does-fedora-coreos-replace-container-linux-what-happens-to-cl/42[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== Does Fedora CoreOS replace Fedora Atomic Host? What happens to Fedora Atomic Host and CentOS Atomic Host?

Fedora CoreOS is the official successor to Fedora Atomic Host. The
last Fedora Atomic Host release was version 29, which has now reached
end-of-life.

CentOS Atomic Host will continue producing downstream rebuilds of RHEL
Atomic Host and will align with the end-of-life. The Fedora CoreOS
project will be the consolidation point for the community distributions.
Users are encouraged to move there in the future.

== What happens to Project Atomic?

Project Atomic is an umbrella project consisting of two flavors of
Atomic Host (Fedora and CentOS) as well as various other
container-related projects. Project Atomic as a project name will be
sunset by the end of 2018 with a stronger individual focus on its
successful projects such as Buildah and Cockpit. This merges the
community side of the operating system more effectively with Fedora and
allows for a clearer communication for other community-supported
projects, specifically the well-adopted
https://twitter.com/hashtag/nobigfatdaemons?src=hash[#nobigfatdaemons]
approach of https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah[Buildah] and the
versatile GUI server manager https://cockpit-project.org/[Cockpit].

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-what-happens-to-project-atomic/44/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== Technical FAQ

=== Where can I download Fedora CoreOS?

Fedora CoreOS artifacts are available at https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/[getfedora.org].

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-where-can-i-download-fedora-coreos/47/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== Does Fedora CoreOS embrace the Container Linux Update Philosophy?

Yes, Fedora CoreOS comes with automatic
updates and regular releases. Multiple update channels are provided
catering to different users' needs. It introduces a new node-update
service based on rpm-ostree technologies, with a server component that
can be optionally self-hosted. Failures that prevent an update from
booting will automatically be reverted.

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-does-fedora-coreos-embrace-the-container-linux-update-philosophy/48/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== How are Fedora CoreOS nodes provisioned? Can I re-use existing cloud-init configurations?

Fedora CoreOS is provisioned with Ignition. However, existing
Ignition configurations will require changes, as the OS configuration
will be different from Container Linux. Existing cloud-init
configurations are not supported and will need to be migrated into their
Ignition equivalent.

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-how-are-fedora-coreos-nodes-provisioned-can-i-re-use-existing-cloud-init-configurations/49/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== What data persists across upgrades and reboots?

The directories `/etc` and `/var` are mounted as read-write which lets users
write and modify files.

The directory `/etc` may be changed by deployments, but will not override user
made changes. The content under `/var` is left untouched by rpm-ostree when
applying upgrades or rollbacks. For more information, refer to the
https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/administrator-handbook/#filesystem-layout[filesystem
layout].

== How do I migrate from Container Linux to Fedora CoreOS?

Migrations can be accomplished by re-provisioning the machine with
Fedora CoreOS. For notes on migrating from Container Linux
to Fedora CoreOS, see the xref:migrate-cl.adoc[migration guide].

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-how-do-i-migrate-from-container-linux-to-fedora-coreos/50/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== How do I migrate from Fedora Atomic Host to Fedora CoreOS?

As with Container Linux, the best practice is to re-provision the node, due
to the cloud-init/Ignition transition at least. Since Fedora CoreOS uses
rpm-ostree technology, it may be possible to rebase from Fedora
Atomic Host to Fedora CoreOS, but it is not recommended. It's
preferable to gain experience deploying systems using Ignition so
that they can be re-provisioned easily if needed. For notes on migrating
from Atomic Host to Fedora CoreOS, see the
xref:migrate-ah.adoc[migration guide].

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-how-do-i-migrate-from-fedora-atomic-host-to-fedora-coreos/51/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== Which container runtimes are available on Fedora CoreOS?

Fedora CoreOS includes Docker and podman by default.
Based on community engagement and support this list could
change over time.

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-which-container-runtimes-are-available-on-fedora-coreos/52/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== Which platforms does Fedora CoreOS support?

Fedora CoreOS runs on at least

* Alibaba Cloud,
* AWS,
* Azure,
* GCP,
* OpenStack,
* QEMU,
* VMware,
* and bare-metal systems if installed to disk or network-booted.

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-which-platforms-does-fedora-coreos-support/53/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== Can I run Kubernetes on Fedora CoreOS?

Yes. However, we envision Fedora CoreOS as not including a specific
container orchestrator (or version of Kubernetes) by default â€” just like
Container Linux and Atomic Host. We will work with the upstream
Kubernetes community on tools (e.g. kubeadm) and best practices for
installing Kubernetes on Fedora CoreOS.

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-can-i-run-kubernetes-on-fedora-coreos/54/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== How do I run custom applications on Fedora CoreOS?

On Fedora CoreOS, containers are the way to install and configure any
software not provided by the base operating system. The package layering
mechanism provided by rpm-ostree will continue to exist for use in
debugging a Fedora CoreOS machine, but we strongly discourage its use.
For more about this, please refer to xref:running-containers.adoc[documentation].

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/launch-faq-how-do-i-run-custom-applications-on-fedora-coreos/55/1[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== Where is my preferred tool for troubleshooting?

The FCOS image is kept minimal by design. Not every troubleshooting tool are
included by default. Instead, it is recommended to use the `toolbox` utility.

xref:debugging-with-toolbox.adoc[Debugging with Toolbox].

== How do I coordinate cluster-wide OS updates? Is locksmith or the Container Linux Update Operator available for Fedora CoreOS?

The `etcd-lock` feature from https://github.com/coreos/locksmith[locksmith] has
been directly ported to Zincati, as a https://coreos.github.io/zincati/usage/updates-strategy/#lock-based-strategy[lock-based updates strategy].
It has also been augmented to support multiple backends, not being anymore
constrained to etcd2 only.

The capabilities of https://github.com/coreos/container-linux-update-operator[Container Linux Update Operator (CLUO)]
have been embedded into the https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator[Machine Config Operator (MCO)],
which is a core component of OKD.
The MCO additionally covers reconciliation of machine configuration changes.

== How do I upload Fedora CoreOS to private AWS EC2 regions?

Fedora CoreOS today is only uploaded to the standard AWS regions. For regions
in other AWS partitions like GovCloud and AWS China, you must upload the images
yourself.

Note that Fedora CoreOS uses a unified BIOS/UEFI partition layout. As such, it
is not compatible with the `aws ec2 import-image` API (for more information,
see https://github.com/openshift/os/pull/396[related discussions]). Instead,
you must use `aws ec2 import-snapshot` combined with `aws ec2 register-image`.

To learn more about these APIs, see the AWS documentation for
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-import-snapshot.html[importing snapshots]
and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot[creating EBS-backed AMIs].

== Can I run containers via docker and podman at the same time?

No. Running containers via `docker` and `podman` at the same time can cause
issues and unexpected behavior. We highly recommend against trying to use them
both at the same time.

It is worth noting that in Fedora CoreOS we have `docker.service`
disabled by default but it is easily started if anything communicates
with the `/var/run/docker.sock` because `docker.socket` is enabled by
default. This means that if a user runs any `docker` command (via
`sudo docker`) then the daemon will be activated. We did this to make
the transition easier for users of Container Linux.

In https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/408[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#408]
it was pointed out that because of socket activation users who are
using `podman` for containers could unintentionally start the docker
daemon. This could weaken the security of the system because of the
interaction of both container runtimes with the firewall on the system.
To prevent making this mistake you can disable `docker` completely by
masking the `docker.service` systemd unit.

.Example fcct config for disabling docker.service
[source, yaml]

variant: fcos
version: 1.2.0
systemd:
  units:
    - name: docker.service
      mask: true

== Are Fedora CoreOS x86_64 disk images hybrid BIOS+UEFI bootable?

The x86_64 images we provide can be used for either BIOS (legacy) boot or UEFI boot. They contain a hybrid BIOS/UEFI partition setup that allows them to be used for either. The exception to that is the `metal4k` 4k native image, which is targeted at disks with 4k sectors and https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/blob/12029fea7798fa5d3535eafcf8c3d02f9a6095e4/src/cmd-buildextend-metal#L200-L202[does not have a BIOS boot partition] because 4k native disks are https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/hard-drives-and-partitions#advanced-format-drives[only supported with UEFI].

https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/are-fedora-coreos-disk-images-hybrid-bios-uefi-bootable/21911[Discuss on discussion.fedoraproject.org]

== What's the difference between Ignition and FCCT configurations?

Ignition configuration is a low-level interface used to define the whole set of customizations for an instance.
It is primarily meant as a machine-friendly interface, with content encoded as JSON and a fixed structure defined via JSON-Schema.
This JSON configuration is processed by each FCOS instance upon first boot.

Many high-level tools exist that can produce an Ignition configuration starting from their own specific input formats,
such as `terraform`, `matchbox`, `openshift-installer`, and `fcct`.

Fedora CoreOS Configuration Transpiler (`fcct`) is one of such high-level tools.
It is primarily meant as a human-friendly interface, thus defining its own richer configuration entries and using YAML documents as input.
This YAML configuration is never directly processed by FCOS instances (only the resulting Ignition configuration is).

Although similar, Ignition configurations and FCCT ones do not have the same structure; thus, converting between them is not just a direct YAML-to-JSON translation, but it involves additional logic.
FCCT exposes several customization helpers (e.g. distribution specific entries and common abstractions) that are not present in Ignition and make the formats not interchangeable.
Additionally, the different formats (YAML for FCCT, JSON for Ignition) help to avoid mixing up inputs by mistake.

== What is the format of the version number?

This is covered in detail in the https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/blob/master/Design.md#version-numbers[design docs].

The summary is that Fedora CoreOS uses the format `X.Y.Z.A`

* `X` is the Fedora major version (i.e. `32`)
* `Y` is the datestamp that the package set was snapshotted from Fedora (i.e. `20200715`)
* `Z` is a code number used by official builds
** `1` for the `next` stream
** `2` for the `testing` stream
** `3` for the `stable` stream
* `A` is a revision number that is incremented for each new build with the same `X.Y.Z` parameters

The version numbering scheme is subject to change and is not intended to be parsed by machine.

== Why is the dnsmasq.service systemd unit masked?

We have found that the dnsmasq binary can be used for several host
applications, including podman and NetworkManager. For this reason we
include the dnsmasq package in the base OSTree layer, but we discourage
the use of the dnsmasq.service in the host by masking it with
`systemctl mask dnsmasq.service`.

_"Why do you mask the service?"_

dnsmasq is useful for running a DHCP/DNS/TFTP server for external clients
(i.e. not local to the host), too, but that is something we'd prefer users
to do in a container. Putting the service in a container insulates the
hosted service from breakage as a result of host layer changes. For
example, if NetworkManager and podman stopped using dnsmasq, we would
remove it from the host and the service you depend on would cease to
work.

_"But, I really want to use it!"_

We don't recommend it, but if you really want to use it you can just
unmask and enable it:

.Example fcct config for unmasking dnsmasq.service
[source, yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0
systemd:
  units:
    - name: dnsmasq.service
      mask: false
      enabled: true
----

For more information see
https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/519[the tracker issue discussion].

== Why does SSH stop working after upgrading to Fedora 33?

In Fedora 33 there was a change to
https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/StrongCryptoSettings2[implement stronger crypto defaults].
Part of this included taking the
https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.3[advice of OpenSSH] upstream
and disabling the use of the `ssh-rsa` public key signature algorithm.

You may hit issues if you use RSA keys and:

* use an old version of the `SSH` client
* use tooling/software libraries that don't support using RSA SHA2 host key signatures

For example, Go has an https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37278[open issue]
to solve this problem in its SSH implementation, but has yet to resolve it.
This has been hit and worked around by the FCOS community in
our build tooling and also our higher level projects:

- https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/699[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#699]
- https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/issues/1772[coreos/coreos-assembler#1772]

If you run into this problem and need to work around the issue, you
have a few options:

- Switch to a newer non-RSA key type.
- Provide a configuration to your machine that re-enables the insecure key signatures:

.Example fcct config for re-enabling SSH RSA SHA1 key signatures
[source, yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0

      mode: 0600
      contents:
        inline: |
          PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa
----

== Why do I get SELinux denials after updates if I have local policy modifications?

Currently the OSTree and SELinux tooling conflict a bit. If you have
permanently applied local policy modifications then policy updates
delivered by the OS will no longer apply; your policy stays frozen.
This means any policy "fixes" needed to enable new functionality will
not get applied. See
https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/701[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#701]
for more details.

This means you may see denials like the following, which can take down critical parts
of a system like in
https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/700[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#700]:

.Example SELinux denial
[source, text]
----
systemd-resolved[755]: Failed to symlink /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf: Permission denied
audit[755]: AVC avc:  denied  { create } for  pid=755 comm="systemd-resolve" name=".#stub-resolv.confc418434d59d7d93a" scontext=system_u:system_r:systemd_resolved_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:systemd_resolved_var_run_t:s0 tclass=lnk_file permissive=0
----

To see if your system currently has local policy modifications you can
run `ostree admin config-diff`. The following system has a modified
policy:

.Example system with a modified SELinux policy
[source, text]
----
$ sudo ostree admin config-diff | grep selinux/targeted/policy
M    selinux/targeted/policy/policy.32
----

To work around this incompatibility, please attempt to apply policy
modifications dynamically. For example, for an SELinux boolean you can use the
following systemd unit that executes on every boot:

.Example fcct config for dynamically applying SELinux boolean
[source, yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.1.0
systemd:
  units:
    - name: setsebool.service
      enabled: true
      contents: |
        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        ExecStart=setsebool container_manage_cgroup true
        RemainAfterExit=yes
        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

If your system's basic functionality has stopped working because of
SELinux denials check to see if your system currently has local policy
modifications. You can check with `ostree admin config-diff`:

.Example system with a modified SELinux policy
[source, text]
----
$ sudo ostree admin config-diff | grep selinux/targeted/policy
M    selinux/targeted/policy/policy.32
----

If your system is in this state you have two options:

* Re-deploy starting with the latest image artifacts.
** This means you start with the latest policy.
* Follow the workaround in https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/701[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#701] to restore the base policy.
