= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on VMware

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) nodes on the VMware hypervisor.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning an FCOS machine, you must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

You also need to have access to a working VMware infrastructure, supporting VMs with at least hardware version 13.
The examples below use the https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/blob/v0.22.2/govc/README.md[govc] command-line tool for remote vSphere provisioning and the https://code.vmware.com/web/tool/4.4.0/ovf[ovftool] for local Workstation or Fusion provisoning.

=== Downloading the OVA

Fedora CoreOS is designed to be updated automatically, with different schedules per stream.
Once you have picked the relevant stream, you can download the latest OVA:

[source, bash]
----
STREAM="stable"
mkdir ova-templates
coreos-installer download -s "${STREAM}" -p vmware -f ova -C ./ova-templates/
----

Alternatively, OVA images can be manually downloaded from the https://getfedora.org/coreos/download/[download page].

=== Encoding Ignition configuration

For the `vmware` provider, Ignition requires two "guestinfo" fields to be present when the VM is first booted:

* `guestinfo.ignition.config.data.encoding`: the encoding of the Ignition configuration.
* `guestinfo.ignition.config.data`: the content of the Ignition configuration, encoded according to the format above.

For maximum compatibility, it is recommended to use `base64` encoding and to prepare the Ignition configuration as such:

[source, bash]
----
CONFIG_ENCODING='base64'
CONFIG_ENCODED=$(cat example.ign | base64 -w0 -)
----

An alternative to plain `base64` encoding is `gzip+base64` as described in the https://coreos.github.io/ignition/supported-platforms/[Ignition support platforms]. This is especially useful when submitting the Ignition Config via `govc` as _inline_ parameter. In that case the maximum length for shell arguments called `ARG_MAX` comes into play. Depending on the platform you are on, it may be impossible to submit your config inline unless it was compressed with `gzip`. Call `getconf ARG_MAX` in your shell to see the local limit.

[source, bash]
----
CONFIG_ENCODING='gzip+base64'
CONFIG_ENCODED=$(cat example.ign | gzip | base64 -w0 -)
----

== Booting a new VM on Workstation or Fusion

This section shows how to use Workstation and Fusion facilities to configure and run VMs from the command-line. Some steps can potentially be performed via the graphical UI too.

=== Importing the OVA

The downloaded OVA has to be imported into the Workstation or Fusion library locally. At the same time the Ignition has to be provided for it to be applied to the VM.

[source, bash]
----
VM_NAME='fcos-node01'
FCOS_OVA='./ova-templates/fedora-coreos-31.20200210.3.0-vmware.x86_64.ova'
LIBRARY="$HOME/Virtual Machines.localized"
ovftool \
  --powerOffTarget \
  --name="${VM_NAME}" \
  --allowExtraConfig \
  --extraConfig:guestinfo.ignition.config.data.encoding="${CONFIG_ENCODING}" \
  --extraConfig:guestinfo.ignition.config.data="${CONFIG_ENCODED}" \
  "${FCOS_OVA}" "${LIBRARY}"
----

Afterwards you can refresh the list of VMs in the Workstation or Fusion UI and the new `fcos-node01` VM should appear ready for booting. Its hardware configuration can be further customized at this point, and then powered-up.

== Booting a new VM on vSphere

This section shows how to use vSphere facilities to configure and run VMs from the command-line. Similar steps can be performed via the graphical UI too.

=== Importing the OVA

The downloaded OVA has to be first imported into vSphere library:

[source, bash]
----
FCOS_OVA='./ova-templates/fedora-coreos-31.20200210.3.0-vmware.x86_64.ova'
LIBRARY='fcos-images'
TEMPLATE_NAME='fcos-31.20200210.3.0'
govc session.login -u 'user:password@host'
govc library.create "${LIBRARY}"
govc library.import -n "${TEMPLATE_NAME}" "${LIBRARY}" "${FCOS_OVA}"
----

=== Setting up a new VM

You can now deploy a new VM, starting from the template in the library and the encoded Ignition configuration:

[source, bash]
----
VM_NAME='fcos-node01'
govc library.deploy "${LIBRARY}/${TEMPLATE_NAME}" "${VM_NAME}"
govc vm.change -vm "${VM_NAME}" -e "guestinfo.ignition.config.data.encoding=${CONFIG_ENCODING}"
govc vm.change -vm "${VM_NAME}" -e "guestinfo.ignition.config.data=${CONFIG_ENCODED}"
----

A new `fcos-node01` VM is now available for booting. Its hardware configuration can be further customized at this point, and then powered-up:

[source, bash]
----
govc vm.info -e "${VM_NAME}"
govc vm.power -on "${VM_NAME}"
----

=== First-boot networking and Ignition

Ignition supports referencing remote content in configuration and fetching it at provisioning time.
For this reason, on first-boot FCOS instances try to perform network autoconfiguration via DHCP.

If your VMware setup employs static network configuration instead, you can override this automatic DHCP setup with your own custom configuration.
Custom networking command-line `ip=` parameter can be configured via guestinfo properties as shown below, before booting a VM for the first time.

The provisioning flow follows the usual steps, plus an additional `guestinfo.afterburn.initrd.network-kargs` entry.

NOTE: if you are using a provisioning method other than `govc`, make sure that the guestinfo attribute is provisioned in the VM's Advanced Configuration Parameters (also known as `ExtraConfig`). Some management tools may default to a vApp Property instead, which does not work in this scenario.

[source, bash]
----
VM_NAME='fcos-node02'
IFACE='ens192'
IPCFG="ip=192.0.2.42::192.0.2.1:255.255.255.0:${VM_NAME}:${IFACE}:off"

govc library.deploy "${LIBRARY}/${TEMPLATE_NAME}" "${VM_NAME}"
govc vm.change -vm "${VM_NAME}" -e "guestinfo.ignition.config.data.encoding=${CONFIG_ENCODING}"
govc vm.change -vm "${VM_NAME}" -e "guestinfo.ignition.config.data=${CONFIG_ENCODED}"
govc vm.change -vm "${VM_NAME}" -e "guestinfo.afterburn.initrd.network-kargs=${IPCFG}"
govc vm.info -e "${VM_NAME}"
govc vm.power -on "${VM_NAME}"
----

The full syntax of the `ip=` parameter is documented in https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html[Dracut manpages].

For further information on first-boot networking, see https://coreos.github.io/afterburn/usage/initrd-network-cmdline/[Afterburn documentation].

== Troubleshooting First-boot Problems

You may encounter problems with your Ignition configuration that require access to the system log which appears during first-boot. To make a copy of the system log you can attach a serial device to the VM before booting. vSphere as well as Workstation and Fusion allow this and will save the output to a file of your choice.

To attach a serial device simply modify the hardware settings of the powered off VM and add a `Serial Port`. Select the destination and name of the file to be created. Afterwards power on the VM. When encountering an error, check the file you initially specified â€“ it should contain a copy of the system log.

The serial device can also be added to the VM via `govc` as described in the https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/blob/master/govc/USAGE.md#deviceserialconnect[official usage documentation]:

[source, bash]
----
VM_NAME='fcos-node01'

govc device.serial.add -vm "${VM_NAME}"
govc device.serial.connect -vm "${VM_NAME}" "[datastore] ${VM_NAME}/console.log"
