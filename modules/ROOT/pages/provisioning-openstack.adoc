= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on OpenStack

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) nodes on an
OpenStack cloud environment, either private, or public (like https://vexxhost.com/[VEXXHOST]).

The steps below were tested against the OpenStack Victoria release.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning an FCOS machine, you must have an Ignition configuration file
containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see
xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

You also need to have access to an OpenStack environment and a functioning
https://docs.openstack.org/python-designateclient/latest/user/shell-v2.html[`openstack` CLI].
Typically you'll https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/configuration/index.html[configure the client]
by using a `clouds.yaml` file or via environment variables. If you're starting from scratch, this
environment may need networks, SSH keypairs, security groups, etc.. set up. Please consult the
https://docs.openstack.org/[OpenStack Documentation] to learn more.

== Downloading an OpenStack Image

Fedora CoreOS is designed to be updated automatically, with different schedules per stream.
Once you have picked the relevant stream, download, verify, and decompress the latest
OpenStack image:

NOTE: For more information on FCOS stream offerings see xref:update-streams.adoc[Update Streams].

[source, bash]
----
STREAM='stable'
coreos-installer download --decompress -s $STREAM -p openstack -f qcow2.xz
----

Alternatively, you can manually download an OpenStack image from the
https://getfedora.org/coreos/download?tab=cloud_operators[download page].
Verify the download, following the instructions on that page, and decompress it.

== Uploading the Image to OpenStack

.Create the FCOS image in OpenStack
[source, bash]
----
FILE=fedora-coreos-XX.XXXXXXXX.X.X-openstack.x86_64.qcow2
IMAGE=${FILE:0:-6} # pull off .qcow2
openstack image create --disk-format=qcow2 --min-disk=10 --min-ram=2 --file=$FILE $IMAGE
----

.Monitor image creation progress by listing the image
[source, bash]
----
openstack image list --name=$IMAGE
----

== Launching a VM instance

Now that you have an image created in your account you can launch a VM
instance. Youâ€™ll have to specify several pieces of information in the
command, such as instance flavor, network information, SSH key, etc...

You'll also need the Ignition config you created earlier. Here it is
represented in the example command as `./example.ign`, which indicates
a file in the current directory named `example.ign`.

.Lauching a VM instance
[source, bash]
----
OPENSTACK_NETWORK=private
OPENSTACK_KEYPAIR=mykeypair # optional
OPENSTACK_FLAVOR=v1-standard-2
INSTANCE_NAME=myinstance # choose a name
openstack server create            \
     --key-name=$OPENSTACK_KEYPAIR \
     --network=$OPENSTACK_NETWORK  \
     --flavor=$OPENSTACK_FLAVOR    \
     --image=$IMAGE                \
     --user-data ./example.ign     \
     $INSTANCE_NAME
----

NOTE: Specifying `--key-name` is optional if you provide an SSH key in your Ignition config.

TIP: Monitor progress of the instance creation with `openstack server show $INSTANCE_NAME`.

Next, if you'd like to SSH into the instance from outside the
OpenStack environment, you can assign a public IP to the instance:

.Create and Assign a Floating IP
[source, bash]
----
OPENSTACK_NETWORK=public
openstack floating ip create $OPENSTACK_NETWORK

FLOATING_IP=1.1.1.1  # from just created floating IP
openstack server add floating ip $INSTANCE_NAME $FLOATING_IP
----

Now you should be able to SSH into the instance using the IP address
associated with the floating IP. If you didn't change the defaults, the
username is `core` and `ssh core@$FLOATING_IP` should work.
