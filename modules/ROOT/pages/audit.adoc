= Managing the audit daemon (`auditd`)

Starting with the first release based on Fedora 39, Fedora CoreOS includes the audit daemon (`auditd`) to load and manage audit rules.

Like all system daemons on Fedora CoreOS, the audit daemon is managed by systemd but with an exception: it can not be stopped or restarted via `systemctl stop auditd` or `systemctl restart auditd` for compliance reasons.

From https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2664811[Unable to restart/stop auditd service using systemctl command in RHEL]:

"The reason for this unusual handling of restart/stop requests is that auditd is treated specially by the kernel: the credentials of a process that sends a killing signal to auditd are saved to the audit log. The audit developers do not want to see the credentials of PID 1 logged there. They want to see the login UID of the user who initiated the action."

To stop and restart the audit daemon, you should use the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo auditctl --signal stop
$ sudo systemctl start auditd.service  # Only if you want it started again
----

You may also use the following commands to reload the rules, rotate the logs, resume logging or dump the daemon state:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo auditctl --signal reload
$ sudo auditctl --signal rotate
$ sudo auditctl --signal resume
$ sudo auditctl --signal state
----

See https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditctl.8.html[auditctl(8)] and https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/auditd.8.html[auditd(8)] for more details about those commands.
