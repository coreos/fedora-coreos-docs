= Booting Fedora CoreOS: Intermediate Provisioning Scenario

This tutorial begin where xref:getting-started-tutorial.adoc[Getting Started with Fedora CoreOS Tutorial] left off.
Where we configured the Fedora CoreOS related tools and provisioned a basic instance with a Systemd dropin unit.

For a more intermediate provisioning scenario let's add an SSH key to our `authorized_keys` file and run a script on the first boot.
We'll add to the `fcct` config from the previous scenario such that the provisioning configuration will now tell Ignition to:

* Add a systedmd dropin for auto login from serial console.
* Disable automatic updates
* Add a script at `/usr/local/bin/public-ipv4.sh` to run on boot
* Configure a systemd service to run the script on first boot.

== Write the Script

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "Detected Public IPv4: is $(curl https://ipv4.icanhazip.com)" > \
         /run/console-login-helper-messages/issue.d/30_public-ipv4.issue
----

This script uses https://icanhazip.com/[icanhazip.com] to update the issuegen from https://github.com/coreos/console-login-helper-messages[console-login-helper-messages] to output the node's public IPv4 address on the serial console during bootup.
This is useful in cloud environments when you might have different public and private addresses.

We'll store this script into `/usr/local/bin/public-ipv4.sh` when we provision the machine. We'll encode it into an FCCT config here shortly.

=== Write the Systemd Service

We need to call the script from the previous section by using a systemd unit.
Here is one that works for what we want, which is to execute on first boot and not again:

[source,service]
----
[Unit]
Before=console-login-helper-messages-issuegen.service
After=network-online.target
ConditionPathExists=!/var/lib/issuegen-public-ipv4
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/public-ipv4.sh
ExecStartPost=/usr/local/bin/touch /var/lib/issuegen-public-ipv4
RemainAfterExit=yes
[Install]
WantedBy=console-login-helper-messages-issuegen.service
----

We'll call this unit `issuegen-public-ipv4.service` and we'll embed it into the FCCT config in the next section.

=== Write FCCT and convert to Ignition

The final FCCT for what we want to do is shown below.
We'll store these contents in `fcct-intermediate.yaml`.

[source,yml]

----

      dropins:

        contents: |
          [Service]
          # Override Execstart in main unit
          ExecStart=
          # Add new Execstart with `-` prefix to ignore failure
          ExecStart=-/usr/sbin/agetty --autologin core --noclear %I $TERM
          TTYVTDisallocate=no
    - name: issuegen-public-ipv.service

      contents: |
        [Unit]

        After=network-online.target
        ConditionPathExists=!/var/lib/issuegen-public-ipv4
        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/public-ipv4.sh
        ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/touch /var/lib/issuegen-public-ipv4

        [Install]
        WantedBy=console-login-helper-messages-issuegen.service

    - path: /etc/zincati/config.d/90-disable-auto-updates.toml
      contents:
        inline: |
          [updates]
          enabled = false
    - path: /usr/local/bin/public-ipv4.sh
      mode: 0755
      contents:
        inline: |
          [updates]
          enabled = false
    - path: /usr/local/bin/public-ipv4.sh
      mode: 0755
      contents:
        inline: |
          #!/bin/bash
          echo "Detected Public IPv4: is $(curl https://ipv4.icanhazip.com)" > \
              /run/console-login-helper-messages/issue.d/30_public-ipv4.issue
----

And then convert to Ignition:

[source,bash]
----
[host]$ fcct --pretty --strict fcct-intermediate.yaml --output intermediate.ign
----

=== Test it out

Just as before we'll use the following to boot the instance:

[source,bash]
----
[host]$ chcon --verbost unconfined_u:object_r:svirt_home_t:s0 intermediate.ign
[host]$ virt-install --name=fcos --vcpus=2 --ram=2048 --import \
            --network=bridge=virbr0 --graphics=none \
            --qemu-commandline="-fw_cfg name=opt/com.coreos/config,file=${PWD}/intermediate.ign" \
            --disk=size=20,backing_store=${PWD}/fedora-coreos[stream_version].qcow2
----

And view on the serial console that the `Detected Public IPv4` is shown in the serial console output right before you're dropped to a login prompt:

[source,bash]
----
[  OK  ] Started RPM-OSTree System Management Daemon.

Fedora CoreOS preview [stream_version]

eth0: 192.168.122.20 fe80::5054:ff:feb2:e7f9
localhost login: core (automatic login)

[core@localhost ~]$
----

And the service shows it was launched successfully:

[source,bash]
----
$ systemctl status issuegen-public-ipv4.service | cat

----

Now let's take down the instance for the next test. First, disconnect from the serial console by pressing `CTRL` + `]` and then destroy the machine:

[source,bash]
----
[host]$ virsh destory fcos
[host]$ virsh undefined --remove-all-storage fcos
----
