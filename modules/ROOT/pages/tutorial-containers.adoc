= Setting up SSH access and starting containers at boot

NOTE: Complete all the steps described in the xref:tutorial-setup.adoc[initial setup page] before starting this tutorial. Make sure you have create file `ssh-key.pub` following the instructions provided in the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/tutorial-setup/#_ssh_public_key[prerequisites] for the tutorial. We will use this key in the Butane configuration file that we are about to write.

In this tutorial, we will set up SSH access and start a container at boot. Fedora CoreOS is focused on running applications/services in containers thus we recommend trying to run containers and avoid modifying the host directly. Running containers and keeping a pristine host layer makes automatic updates more reliable and allows for separation of concerns with the Fedora CoreOS team responsible for the OS and end-user operators/sysadmins responsible for the applications.

As usual, we will set up console autologin, a hostname, systemd pager configuration, but we will also:

* Add an SSH Key for the `core` user from the local `ssh-key.pub` file.
* Add a systemd service (`failure.service`) that fails on boot.
* Add a running container via a Podman https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html[quadlet systemd.unit container file].
    * This `etcd-member.container` will then be associated with a `etcd-member.service` on the running system.
    * `etcd-member.service` will launch and manage the lifecycle of the container using `podman`.

== Writing the Butane config and converting to Ignition

Similarly to what we did in the second provisioning scenario, we will write the following Butane config in a file called `containers.bu`:

Run Butane to convert that to an Ignition config:

[source,bash]

butane --pretty --strict --files-dir=./ containers.bu --output containers.ign
----

Now let's provision it:

[source,bash]
----
# Setup the correct SELinux label to allow access to the config
chcon --verbose --type svirt_home_t containers.ign

# Start a Fedora CoreOS virtual machine
virt-install --name=fcos --vcpus=2 --ram=2048 --os-variant=fedora-coreos-stable \
    --import --network=bridge=virbr0 --graphics=none \

    --disk="size=20,backing_store=${PWD}/fedora-coreos.qcow2"

On the console you will see:

[systemd]
Failed Units: 1
  failure.service
----

The `Failed Units` message is coming from the https://github.com/coreos/console-login-helper-messages[console login helper messages] helpers. This particular helper shows us when `systemd` has services that are in a failed state. In this case we made `failure.service` with `ExecStart=/usr/bin/false`, so we intentionally created a service that will always fail in order to illustrate the helper messages.

Now that we’re up and don’t have any real failures we can check out the status of `etcd-member.service`, which was generated from our `etcd-member.container` file.

----

We can also inspect the state of the container that was run by the systemd service:

----
[core@tutorial ~]$ sudo podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                       COMMAND               CREATED        STATUS        PORTS       NAMES
31af97b0ef90  quay.io/coreos/etcd:latest  /usr/local/bin/et...  4 minutes ago  Up 4 minutes              etcd
----

And we can set a key/value pair in etcd. For now let’s set the key `fedora` to the value `fun`:

----
[core@tutorial ~]$ curl -L -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/fedora -d value="fun"
{"action":"set","node":{"key":"/fedora","value":"fun","modifiedIndex":4,"createdIndex":4}}
[core@tutorial ~]$ curl -L http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/ 2>/dev/null | jq .
{
  "action": "get",
  "node": {
    "dir": true,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "key": "/fedora",
        "value": "fun",
        "modifiedIndex": 4,
        "createdIndex": 4
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Looks like everything is working!

== Cleanup

Now let's take down the instance for the next test. Disconnect from the serial console by pressing `CTRL` + `]` or from SSH and then destroy the machine:

----
virsh destroy fcos
virsh undefine --remove-all-storage fcos
----

You may now proceed with the xref:tutorial-user-systemd-unit-on-boot.adoc[next tutorial].
