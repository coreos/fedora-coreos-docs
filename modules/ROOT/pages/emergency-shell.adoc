= Access the emergency shell on boot.

If there is an error while booting Fedora CoreOS and emergency.target is reached a shell prompt will open by default on ttyS0 (i.e. serial console). This usually only happens during first-boot provisioning..

To access the emergency shell when not using a serial console, you should intercept the GRUB menu and edit the entry to drop all 'console' parameters from the kernel line that you don't need, then press Ctrl+X to resume booting.

For VGA, you would keep 'console=tty0'
