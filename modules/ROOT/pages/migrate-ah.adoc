= Migrating from Fedora Atomic Host (FAH) to Fedora CoreOS (FCOS)

== Overview

https://www.projectatomic.io/[Fedora Atomic Host] was a system to deploy applications in containers. Existing FAH users are encouraged to migrate to FCOS, as the project has reached its end-of-life.

FAH used `cloud-init` for provisioning, which required users to provide a `cloud-config` file as userdata for configuration of the instance. Since FCOS Ignition and `cloud-init` are different and have overlapping feature sets, it is not trivial to convert `cloud-init` files to Ignition. Currently, there is no tool for this conversion, so you must manually convert `cloud-init` configs to Fedora CoreOS configs. Refer to xref:fcct-config.adoc[FCCT Specification] for an explanation of the available configuration options.

== Converting `cloud-init` and `cloud-config` userdata

The following examples show the difference between FAH userdata and user configuration with FCC.

.Example of FAH userdata file:
----
#cloud-config
password: atomic
ssh_pwauth: True
chpasswd: { expire: False }

ssh_authorized_keys:
  - ssh-rsa ...
----

This can be manually translated into a xref:ign-passwd.adoc[`passwd`] node within the FCC file:

.Example of users:
[source, yaml]
----
passwd:
  users:
    - name: core
      password_hash: "$6$5s2u6/jR$un0AvWnqilcgaNB3Mkxd5yYv6mTlWfOoCYHZmfi3LDKVltj.E8XNKEcwWm..."
      ssh_authorized_keys:
        - "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDGdByTgSVHq......."
      groups: [ sudo, docker ]
----

== Converting storage definitions

With FAH, you could configure additional storage for the system with either `cloud-init` or  `docker-storage-setup` via the `/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup` file. With FCOS, you should configure additional storage at provisioning time via Ignition in the xref:ign-storage.adoc[`storage`] node of the FCC file.
