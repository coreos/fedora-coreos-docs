= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on libvirt

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) instances on a https://libvirt.org/[libvirt] platform, using the https://www.qemu.org/[QEMU] hypervisor.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning a FCOS instance, you must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

You also need to have access to an host machine with `libvirt`. The examples below use the `virt-install` command-line tool, which must be separately installed beforehand.

TIP: If running on a host with SELinux enabled (use the `sestatus` command to check SELinux status), make sure your OS image and Ignition file are labeled as `svirt_home_t`. You can do this by placing them under `~/.local/share/libvirt/images/` or running `chcon -t svirt_home_t /path/to/file`.
