= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on Amazon Web Services

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) instances on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning a FCOS instance, you must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

You also need to have access to an AWS account. The examples below use the https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[aws] command-line tool, which must be separately installed and configured beforehand.
