= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on Amazon Web Services

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) instances on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning an FCOS machine, you must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

If you do not want to use Ignition to get started, you can make use of the https://coreos.github.io/afterburn/platforms/[Afterburn support] and provide an SSH key via the cloud provider and continue from there.

You also need to have access to an AWS account. The examples below use the https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[aws] command-line tool, which must be separately installed and configured beforehand.
