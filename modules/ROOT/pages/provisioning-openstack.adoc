= Provisioning Fedora CoreOS on OpenStack

This guide shows how to provision new Fedora CoreOS (FCOS) nodes on an
OpenStack cloud environment, either private, or public (like https://vexxhost.com/[VEXXHOST]).

The steps below were tested against the OpenStack Victoria release.

== Prerequisites

Before provisioning an FCOS machine, you must have an Ignition configuration file containing your customizations. If you do not have one, see xref:producing-ign.adoc[Producing an Ignition File].

NOTE: Fedora CoreOS has a default `core` user that can be used to explore the OS. If you want to use it, finalize its xref:authentication.adoc[configuration] by providing e.g. an SSH key.

If you do not want to use Ignition to get started, you can make use of the https://coreos.github.io/afterburn/platforms/[Afterburn support].

You also need to have access to an OpenStack environment and a functioning
https://docs.openstack.org/python-designateclient/latest/user/shell-v2.html[`openstack` CLI].
Typically, you'll https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/configuration/index.html[configure the client]
by using a `clouds.yaml` file or via environment variables. If you're starting from scratch, this
environment may need networks, SSH key pairs, security groups, etc.. set up. Please consult the
https://docs.openstack.org/[OpenStack Documentation] to learn more.

== Downloading an OpenStack Image

Fedora CoreOS is designed to be updated automatically, with different schedules per stream.
Once you have picked the relevant stream, download, verify, and decompress the latest
OpenStack image:

NOTE: For more information on FCOS stream offerings see xref:update-streams.adoc[Update Streams].

[source, bash]
----
STREAM="stable"
coreos-installer download --decompress -s $STREAM -p openstack -f qcow2.xz
----

Alternatively, you can manually download an OpenStack image from the
https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/download/?stream=stable#cloud_images[download page].
Verify the download, following the instructions on that page, and decompress it.

== Uploading the Image to OpenStack

.Create the FCOS image in OpenStack
[source, bash]
----
FILE=fedora-coreos-XX.XXXXXXXX.X.X-openstack.x86_64.qcow2
IMAGE=${FILE:0:-6} # pull off .qcow2
openstack image create --disk-format=qcow2 --min-disk=10 --min-ram=2 --progress --file="${FILE}" "${IMAGE}"
----

NOTE: If you're uploading an `aarch64` disk image then add `--property architecture=aarch64`.

.Monitor image creation progress by listing the image
[source, bash]
----
openstack image list --name="${IMAGE}"
----

Once the image is listed as `active`, it's ready to be used.

== Launching a VM instance

Now that you have an image created in your account you can launch a VM
instance. Youâ€™ll have to specify several pieces of information in the
command, such as instance flavor, network information, SSH key, etc...

You'll also need the Ignition config you created earlier. Here it is
represented in the example command as `./example.ign`, which indicates
a file in the current directory named `example.ign`.

.Launching a VM instance
[source, bash]
----
OPENSTACK_NETWORK="private"
OPENSTACK_KEYPAIR="mykeypair" # optional
OPENSTACK_FLAVOR="v1-standard-2"
INSTANCE_NAME="myinstance" # choose a name
openstack server create                \
     --key-name="${OPENSTACK_KEYPAIR}" \
     --network=$OPENSTACK_NETWORK      \
     --flavor=$OPENSTACK_FLAVOR        \
     --image="${IMAGE}"                \
     --user-data ./example.ign         \
     "${INSTANCE_NAME}"
----

NOTE: Specifying `--key-name` is optional if you provide an SSH key in your Ignition config.

TIP: Monitor progress of the instance creation with `openstack server show "${INSTANCE_NAME}"`.
You can also use the `--wait` parameter when calling `openstack server create` to block
until the instance is active.

Next, if the instance's network isn't externally facing and you'd like to SSH
into it from outside the OpenStack environment, you will have to assign a public
IP to the instance:

.Create and Assign a Floating IP
[source, bash]
----
OPENSTACK_NETWORK=public
openstack floating ip create $OPENSTACK_NETWORK

FLOATING_IP=1.1.1.1  # from just created floating IP
openstack server add floating ip "${INSTANCE_NAME}" $FLOATING_IP
----

You now should be able to SSH into the instance using the floating IP address.

.Example connecting
[source, bash]
----
ssh core@<ip address>
----
