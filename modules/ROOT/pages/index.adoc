Fedora CoreOS is an automatically updating, minimal, monolithic, container-focused operating system, designed for clusters but also operable standalone, optimized for Kubernetes but also great without it.
It aims to combine the best of both CoreOS Container Linux and Fedora Atomic Host, integrating technology like Ignition from Container Linux with rpm-ostree and SELinux hardening from Project Atomic.
Its goal is to provide the best container host to run containerized workloads securely and at scale.

Fedora CoreOS is an open source project associated with the link:https://fedoraproject.org/[Fedora Project].
We are aiming for high compatibility with existing Container Linux configuration and user experience, and we expect to provide documentation and tooling to help migrate from Container Linux to Fedora CoreOS.
