= Adding OS extensions to the host system

Fedora CoreOS keeps the base image as simple and small as possible for security and maintainability reasons. That is why you should in general prefer the usage of `podman` containers over layering software.

However, in some cases it is necessary to add software to the base OS itself. For example, drivers or VPN software are potential candidates because they are harder to containerize.

To do this, you can use https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/[`rpm-ostree install`]. Consider these packages as "extensions": they extend the functionality of the base OS rather than e.g. providing runtimes for user applications. That said, there are no restrictions on which packages one can actually install. By default, packages are downloaded from the https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/repositories/[Fedora repositories].

To start the layering of a package, you need to write a systemd unit that executes the `rpm-ostree` command to install the wanted package(s).
Changes are applied to a new deployment and a reboot is necessary for those to take effect.

== Example: Layering vim and setting it as the default editor

Fedora CoreOS includes both `nano` and `vi` as text editors, with the former set as default (see the corresponding https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/UseNanoByDefault[Fedora change]).

This example shows how to install the fully fledged `vim` text editor and how to set it up as default for all users by setting up the required configuration in `/etc/profile.d/`.

NOTE: In the future, we will have a more Ignition-friendly method of doing this with stronger guarantees. See upstream issues https://github.com/coreos/butane/issues/81[butane#81] and https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/681[fedora-coreos-tracker#681] for more information.
